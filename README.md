# Rekki-inspired Home (Next.js App Router)

This is a focused, pixel-polished home page inspired by rekki.com.
It uses Next.js App Router, TailwindCSS, and Framer Motion.

Font handling:
- If you have the Nasalization font files, place them in `/public/fonts/` as:
  - nasalization-regular.woff2
  - nasalization-700.woff2
- The site will load Nasalization if present; otherwise it loads Orbitron from Google Fonts as a close free alternative.

Quick start:
1. npm install
2. npm run dev
3. Open http://localhost:3000
